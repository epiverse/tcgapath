            <li>Date of Recelpt: Clinical Diagnosis & History: Incidental 3 cm left upper pole renal mass. Specimens Submitted: 1: Kidney, Left Upper Pole; Partial Nephrectomy. DIAGNOSIS: 1. Kidney, Left Upper Pole;\" Partial Nephrectomy: Tumor Type: Renal cell carcinoma - Conventional (clear cell) type. Fuhrman Nuclear Grade: Nuclear grade II/IV. Tumor Size: Greatest diameter is 2.4 cm. Local Invasion (for renal cortical types): Not Identified. Renal Vein Invasion: Not identified. Surgical Margins: Free of tumor. Non-Neoplastic Kidney: shows focal chronic inflammation and focal superficial glomerulosclerosis. Adrenal Gland: Not identified. Lymph Nodes: Not identified. Staging for renal cell carcinoma/oncocytoma: pT1 Tumor <= 7.0 cm in greatest dimension limited to the kidney. JATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT IHAVE. REVIEWED AND APPROVED THIS REPORT. Gross Description: 1). The specimen Is received fresh for frozen section consultation, labeled \"\"\"\"left upper pole renal tumor stitch marks deep margin\"\"\"\". It consists of a 6.6 X 3.7 x 2.9 cm wedge shaped portion of kidney with a suture marking the deep margin and attached 12.2 x 8,5 x. 2.7 cm of perirenal. Also received in the same container Is a separate 11.6 x 8.4 x 4.6 cm aggregate of unremarkable. fibroadipose tissue. The margin is inked black and the specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a well-circumscribed cortically. based yellow focally hemorrhagic 2.4 x 2.0 x 1.9 cm tumor. The tumor appears grossly confined to the renal parenchyma, no. extension into perirenal fat is identified. The clearance from the resection margin is 1.1 cm. A representative section of the. nearest margin is submilted for frozen section diagnosis. Representatively submitted. A photograph Is taken. Portions of the. tumor are submitted for TPS. Summary of sections: FSC - frozen section control. T tumor. M margin. RS - representative sections. Summary of Sections: Part 1: Kidney, Left Upper Pole\";\" Partial Nephrectomy. Block. Sect. Site. PCs. 1. fsc. 1. 2. m. 2. 1. rs. 1. 2. t. 2. Intraoperative Consultation: Note: The diagnoses given in this section pertain only to the. tissue sample examined at the time of the intraoperative. consultation. 1). FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS: LEFT UPPER POLE RENAL TUMOR. RENAL CORTICAL NEOPLASM. WITH BENIGN MARGIN. PERMANENT DIAGNOSIS: SAME.</li>
