        <b>Raw TCGA Reports - </b>
        The raw github repository with TCGA Reports, did not activate gh-pages and as a consequence does not serve them with CORS. 
        To solve that, the <a href="https://github.com/jkefeli/tcga-path-reports/blob/main/TCGA_Reports.csv.zip" target="_blank">reference zipped collection of reports</a> was <a href="https://github.com/epiverse/tcgapath/blob/main/TCGA_Reports.csv.zip" target="_blank">uploaded to TCGApath</a>.
